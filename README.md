# Angular 1
This is a basic scaffold of an Angular 1 application.

Install dependencies with 
```
npm install
```

Run local server with
```
npm start 
```

And navigate to
```
/src/index.html
```

Be sure to have the [**api server**](https://github.com/pank879/quoteBackend) up and running in order to access the endpoints.
