# Angular 1
This is a basic scaffold of an Angular powered application built with Webpack.

Install dependencies with 
```
npm install
```

Run local server with
```
npm start 
```

Be sure to have the [**api server**](https://github.com/samsung-sdsa-ise/api) up and running in order to access the endpoints.
